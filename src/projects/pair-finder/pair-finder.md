### Project Name

Pair Finder

### Project Summary

Helps match people with similar schedule and interests to pair.

### Functional Description

The main functionality allows developers interested in pairing will enter times generally available to pair on a regular basis and areas of interest.  You can query for developers with the same interest and available during any of your generally available times.  You can also query by specific interests or times not limited to what you specified for yourself.

Areas of interest uses the tag concept and includes but is not limited to projects, technologies, and organization.When you enter a tag, if the tag does not exist, you are given the option of adding a new tag.  An administrator can combine tags.

The application includes screens that allow you to:
- create an account
- specify and save your areas of interest
- specify and save your schedule
- query people based on interests and schedule.  This screen will include:
    - checkbox for matching based on any of your saved interests.  
       - if checked, people with any of your interests will be selected.
       - if not checked, you can enter a list of interests and people with all of those interests will be selected 
    - checkbox for matching based on your schedule:
      - if checked, people that match any of your times  will be selected.
      - if not checked, you will be able to specify a list of time ranges.  People that match any of those times will be selected.  

### Technical Description

Preferred technology: Firebase, Express, React, Node.  These technologies are performant, feature rich, and lightweight.  For backend, Ruby on Rails was also considered.  However, RoR is relatively slower and heavy weight and Express and Node are on the upward trend.  Mongoose was considered for database - however, Firebase has better integreation with authentication and has other features that make it easier to use.  Firebase is not as scaleable, but it will be easy to switch if scalability becomes an issue.

### Analysis of Needs

#### What problem will the product solve?

There are lots of developers interested in pairing with other developrs with similar interests, but there is no way to find developers with similar interests and matching schedule.

#### What existing products have you look at that have similar functionalities (even if just for a part of the product)? What do you like about those products? What is missing?

There are various development groups where you can advertise that you are looking for someone to pair with.  You may be able to find someone that way.  The Pair Finder app will let you find someone who matches your interest and schedule without relying on them seeing your advertisement.

#### Have you interviewed users to assess the need for this application?

I have had informal discussions with various developers interested.  Paul Reilly has done more in depth research, particularly with need for clean coding.

#### Project Methodology

Assemble a team that can commit to specific times each week and do all programming either pairing or mobbing.  Follow a Kanban like approach. However, predictability will be difficult, as with volunteers schedule and resources can vary.  Try to limit mobs to 3-5, if get more consider breaking out into subteams.  When mobbing, new comers will be encouraged to observe and once attended two or three, encouraged to drive and/or navigate.
